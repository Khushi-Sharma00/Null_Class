# Google Play Store Data Analysis
This project involves analyzing Google Play Store apps using data analytics techniques. The tasks include visualizing installs, revenue, sentiment analysis, and time-series trends with various filtering conditions.

# Tasks Overview

# Task 1: Sentiment Analysis of App Reviews
Performed sentiment analysis on user reviews to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral.
Used Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques taught during training.
Created a stacked bar graph to visualize sentiment distribution.
Saved the visualization as an HTML file, similar to the training method.

# Task 2: Dual-Axis Chart – Installs vs. Revenue
Compared average installs and revenue for free vs. paid apps within the top 3 app categories.
Applied filters:
Apps with ≥ 10,000 installs and ≥ $10,000 revenue.
Android version > 4.0, Size > 15MB, Content Rating = 'Everyone'.
App name ≤ 30 characters (including spaces and special characters).
Restricted graph visibility to be shown only between 1 PM - 2 PM IST.
Saved visualization as an HTML file, following training practices.

# Task 3: Time Series Analysis of Total Installs
Plotted a time series line chart showing the trend of total installs over time, segmented by app category.
Highlighted periods where installs increased by more than 20% month-over-month.
Applied filters:
Content Rating = ‘Teen’, App name starts with ‘E’, Installs > 10,000.
Restricted graph visibility to be shown only between 6 PM - 9 PM IST.
Saved visualization as an HTML file for interactive viewing.

# Next Steps
Upload all visualizations and code to GitHub.
Enhance dashboard integration for better insights.
